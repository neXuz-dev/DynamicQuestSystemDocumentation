# WorldScape Documentation

WorldScape is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5. Create a planet and infinite flat landscape using geometry clipmaps.

**Welcome to documentation for WorldScape Plugin.**

Play on the surface in single player or multiplayer. Guide your imagination to quickly achieve fully procedural infinite playgrounds using noise customize generation through our heightmaps decal system importing 8-bit or 16-bit Heightmaps. The 64-bit precision is executed in runtime to define the surface mesh easily add foliage to your terrain using the procedural foliage system based on humidity and temperature of the surface. Work in a plugin designed for real time.

### Features

- Create an infinite world playable in single player and multiplayer flat and spherical.
- Geometry technology 64bits precision for build surface.
- Create infinitely large and tiny flat worlds.
- Create infinitely large and tiny planets.
- Instanced and multithreaded procedural foliages. (Spawn thanks to the temperature and humidity of the geometry of the ground.)
- Import HeightMaps in 8bit 16bits and apply them to the surface as decals. (They can be added and merged.)
- Editable terrain collision.
- Noise Biome customizable in C++.
- Realistic Lighting for planet.
- WorldShiping Fake 64bits Squared.
- Materials procedural for surface.
- Custom MovementComponent BP.
- Custom Gravity Behavior for planet.

For any kind of support, please visit the [Technical Support Page](#technical-support).

And if you're using Unreal Engine 5 please visit the [Unreal Engine 5 Setting Fixes](#unreal-engine-5-setting-fixes) to avoid issues.

For users still using engine versions below 5 some of the original docs have been saved.

**This documentation will be improved over time.**

# World Generation

## Quick Start

If you prefer to quickly see the technology in action, you can read this page.

### You can open demonstration levels

For good compatibility, enable these native plugins to UnrealEngine below 5.0:

- Enable the **Water plugin** (for ocean material)
- Enable the **Sun Position Calculator** plugin (for good sun setup)

Enable Plugin Content in your ContentBrowserSettings. You may need to enable the show engine content if Plugin is not in project files. A restart may be necessary.

And if you are experiencing surface disappearance or flickering use this console command:
```
r.UseVisibilityOctree 0
```

If you are using 5.0 and above use these options if you are experiencing any visual artifacts: open your project settings and click the all settings tab then in the search bar type in "velocity pass", be sure this is enabled for 5.X to avoid visual bugs.

You are about to create your world. But before that, you have to understand how WorldScape works! Install the plugin and open levels "Demonstration". Wait for the shaders to compile, and press Play on the selected levels shown below in the files.

Here you are in an infinite flat world and an explorable planet above you. The surface is generated in real time under your feet. Now it's up to you to choose what you want to do for your project. You can see in the WorldOutliner, the presence of two actors for the ground. WorldScapeFlat and WorldScapePlanet. Know that you can cumulate grounds. (Flat/planet world).

You can choose the seed in the NOISE menu of the WorldScape actor, a number from (1 to ∞) for a unique visual result.

When you are ready to create a level from scratch, go ahead and refer to the [Setting up a world from scratch](#setting-up-a-world-from-scratch) section for level creation with WorldScape.

### Making big world?

If your goal is to create a huge world, you will have to use World Origin Shifting. Use the "SetWorldOrigin" Function in blueprint and make the origin follow your player location.

---

## Terrain Geometry

WorldScape plugin brings clipMaps technology to the UnrealEngine to create endless landscapes and planets.

### Generation Parameter

You can drag and drop the **WorldScapeManager** BP actor into your level.

You can use the **C++ WorldScapeRoot** directly, the difference with the BP version is only demonstrates setup parameters and allows for easier customization. (If you need to make specific gameplay logic with your terrain you can create a BP actor from the WorldScapeRoot Actor.)

Now you have to choose the type of generation, flat and infinite or spherical with a size to define.

- Choose if your terrain is flat or if it is a planet.
- **Planet scale** allows to define the size of the planet by radius.

### Collision

You can manage terrain collisions in the Collision menu of the WorldScape actor in your world.

Collisions are generated around the player, 1 at the player position, and 8 around. They are generated in safe thread (on the main thread) and are actually very expensive. For this reason, collision resolution should stay low.

**Collision size** is: `Collision Resolution` × `Collision Triangle Size`.

#### Show Collision

Allow the display of the collisions, can only be enabled if collisions are enabled.

#### Collision Dependent Actors

Since generating collision is very expensive, we are limiting collision generation to only be around the player. But you will often need collision to be generated outside of player proximity. For this, **Collision Dependent Actor** is a list of actors that WorldScape will use to generate additional collisions.

### Level Of Detail (LOD)

You can define the definition of your field. The minimum recommended is **MaxLOD: 8** if you have low terrain height variation. But if your game requires altitude, then **MaxLOD: 12** is advised.

- **LOD Resolution:** Number of vertices generated on each axis. Higher resolution allows fine detail to be drawn farther but leads to more expensive terrain generation (slow generation), and can at very high values (500+) lead to lag spikes.
- **TriangleSize:** Distance between each vertex of the terrain when near the ground. If you want finer detail, this is the value to edit.
- **Height Anchor:** As you gain altitude, the detail you need on the ground is lower. This is the distance to ground at which the terrain generation will start doubling the triangle size.
- **Lod Angle min/Max:** This is used for planet type world. The ClipsMaps are projected to the planet, and to allow consistent grid as you move, the grid plan snaps at a set angle of the planet. This has no impact on performance, but low values can lead to more frequent complete generation of the terrain (where it usually only regenerates parts needing update). Should always be a divisor of 360.

### Ocean

The ocean works like the terrain. It uses ClipMaps. You can define a material. Here the material worldScape is a child of the material water from 4.26. (Floating works.)

As for the terrain you can define the resolution / LOD / triangle size. The ocean is deactivatable.

WorldScape is compatible with **Oceanology 5** if you use it on a flat world. For a planet, you have to change shaders & several things. (Tutorial soon.)

### Informations and Debug

The debug information allows you to visualize the distance between the player and the ground, know the altitude and the active list in the load.

---

### Noise Generation

Details about the noise generation and how to use it.

#### Temperature & Humidity System

Noise can output any number of parameters the developer needs.

By default the current system registers 3 parameters generated from the noise in the Mesh Vertex Colour:

- **Height** (Red Channel)
- **Temperature** (Green Channel)
- **Humidity** (Blue Channel)

These are used by the material to color the grass, put mountain and snow texture, or any creative way you can find. (Refer to [Terrain Material](#terrain-material).) If you ever want to change this, you'll have to edit the plugin source code.

#### Noise Seed

Change value in the Seed parameter to generate different terrain variations.

#### Editing the Noise in C++

WorldScape plugin is aimed to have the noise edited in C++. You have the possibility to modify the noise yourself and integrate your own Noise and parameters. There is a barebone example of the noise with comments to guide you.

#### FNoiseData

The noise data are stored in a FNoiseData Struct. You can edit it to fit your need. By default, WorldScape will use and need the following parameters:

- `double` **HeightNormalize** - The height normalized from 0 to 1, also registered in the Red channel of Vertex Color.
- `double` **Height** - The height in Unreal Unit that will displace the terrain either from the center of the planet or up depending on the generation type.
- `float` **Temperature** - Registered in the Green channel of Vertex color, also used for foliage masking.
- `float` **Humidity** - Registered in the Blue channel of Vertex colors, also used for foliage masking.
- `float` **WaterMask** - Used for foliage masking, also set to true for HeightMap Influencer when ocean is higher than terrain.
- `float` **FoliageMask** - Used for foliage Masking.

#### Noise Parameter

Noise Parameter is a struct used as an interface to influence the noise from the viewport. It is present in the WorldScapeRoot component to allow developers to interact with your noise. You can use it to simply change the scale/intensity of the noise, or allow to have completely different generation rules.

#### Required Functions

WorldScape will use 2 specific functions from the WorldScapeNoiseClass:

- `FNoiseData` **GetHeight** - responsible for terrain Noise.
- `FNoiseData` **GetOceanHeight** - responsible for Ocean Noise. It can be used for ocean, river and lake generation.

Rest of the class can be edited as you see fit. You are free to follow the already existing guideline and biome system or write your own system.

---

## Noise System

The Noise asset is very important for making unique looking landscapes. You can create a noise library folder to store your types of preset or custom made noise. Right click in the content browser and in the WorldScape Tab you will see the noise and for this instance call it "NoisePreset1".

Most of the settings you see are very straight forward and do what you expect; however, we are focusing on the "WorldScapeNoise". If you already created the "NoisePreset1" you can drag it in the "World Scape Noise" slot. When you open it, the settings are very straight forward. It is recommended that you experiment with the settings to get a feel of what each one does.

### Example Noise Screenshots

Various noise configurations can produce dramatically different terrains - from smooth rolling hills to jagged mountain ranges and crater-filled landscapes.

---

### Noise Data Asset

Noise Data is a way to save presets of built noise either you have made or using the default ones provided by the plugin.

Depending on what noise you are using, the parameters available will vary on the use of noise, but it is useful for loading in landscape types for your terrain.

---

### Apply your NoiseVolume

The Noise Volume can be used to set noise in a specific area. To create one, right click in the content browser, click "Blueprint Class", in all classes type "Noise Volume" and once created name it what you like.

Then drag it in the level and you're going to notice that in the details panel it looks very similar to the "BP_WorldScapeManager" noise tab. But next you need to make it where "BP_WorldScapeManager" will read the volume and in order to do that click it, scroll down to the Volumes Tab and click the Plus for the Noise Volume list and assign your NoiseVolumeBP.

**You're going to have to scale the NoiseVolumeBP up by a lot. Recommend at least a scale of 28000 or 5000000 on all axis for it to affect a large area. And like before experiment with the values that suits best for your needs.**

---

### Custom Noise Class

Video Tutorial for Custom Noise is available. (Refer to the original documentation page for the embedded video tutorial.)

---

## HeightMap System

Heightmap volumes are very useful for making specific areas look the way you want and work both with flatworld and planets. WorldScape Plugin already has some premade Heightmap Volumes which is shown below in **"Worldscape Content \ Blueprints"**.

Now if you want to create your own Blueprint you can do like you did with the Noise volume but instead type "HeightMapVolume".

#### Creating a HeightMapVolumeData

Now whichever method you did you can drag the HeightMapVolumBP into the level and when you click it you're going to be treated with some new things.

As you see there are some settings and like before go off by their names. But we now have the "HeightMapData". This allows you to choose what kind of heightmap you want to use.

WorldScape Plugin comes with one premade HeightMapData but we are going to make our own. Right click in the content browser and in the WorldScape tab click the HeightMap Volume Data and name it what you like (e.g., "Crater").

Now right click in an empty area of your content browser and click on the WorldScape panel, click on HeighMapVolumeData.

**Side note:** When you double click it, it may not show the settings immediately. If it doesn't, go to the Window tab and click on Details and it will show the settings.

Open it, and you can add a texture heightMap. If your texture is in 16bits check the highResolution parameter. You can export your heightmap from a landscape and convert it to 16bits. Import the texture and add it directly in heightmap texture.

Click to **GENERATE**.

Drag and Drop this in same level to your WorldScape terrain. Add your Heightmap Data to your WorldScape Manager BP.

Look this video: https://youtu.be/_Z3frULvurU

---

### HeightMap Data

HeightMap Data is the data asset that stores the heightmap texture and configuration. You can configure it with 8-bit or 16-bit textures, and toggle the high quality parameter for 16-bit textures to avoid stair-step artifacts.

---

### Apply your Heightmap with Volume

Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/_Z3frULvurU

Add a Height Map Volume in your level. Then add it to the HeightMap Influencer list on your WorldScapeRoot Actor.

Add your Volume in list to WorldScapeActor (panel detail).

You can define the minimum and maximal height for both land and ocean, Temperature and humidity.

---

### Apply your Planetary Heightmap

Planetary heightmaps allow you to apply heightmap data to the entire surface of a planet, wrapping the heightmap texture around the sphere. This follows a similar process to the volume-based heightmap but is applied at the planetary scale.

---

## Hole Volume

**Experimental (use with caution)**

Hole volume can be used to make holes. Right click the content browser and click blueprint class and type "hole".

Apply it under the volumes tab in your WorldScape actor.

### Showcase Example

You can use the foliage mask and overlap the same area of the hole volume to remove the foliage.

If you do not see any effects from the hole volume you may have to edit the master material for the WorldScape manager and multiply the alpha vertex color at the end of the opacity mask lerp.

---

## Collision Invoker Volume (Beta)

Part of the WS tools (beta).

The Collision Invoker Volume provides a way to generate isolated collision for WorldScape terrain. It lays out a collision actor localized under the volume that automatically attaches to the WorldScape actor.

Key settings include:

- **Max Resolution** - limits triangle count to avoid editor performance hits.
- **Quad Size Target** - controls collision mesh resolution based on volume size.
- **Quad Size Auto Correction** - adjusts the target resolution if the volume is too large to maintain reasonable performance at the defined max.
- **Triangle Size** - represents the triangle size in the worldscape mesh generation.

To use, simply place the Collision Invoker Volume over the desired area and click "Make Collision". Make sure it is assigned to the WorldScape root. Invoker actors will appear under the volume and connect to the WorldScape terrain under the collision tabs.

---

## Procedural Foliage

**Video Tutorial:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwTI7dplQck

WorldScape offers the tools to create foliage systems around your landscape automatically so that way you are able to bring out more life into your world you are creating. Refer down into the embedded pages to learn how they work and how you are able to use them.

---

### Placement Constraint Parameters for Foliages

The placement constraint parameters allow you to control where foliage can spawn based on terrain properties such as height, temperature, humidity, slope angle, and water mask values. These parameters give fine-grained control over biome distribution.

---

### Foliage Collection

Foliage Collection is a data asset that groups multiple foliage types together. You can create foliage collections to organize different vegetation types and assign them to your WorldScape terrain.

---

### Foliage Cluster

Foliage Clusters allow you to group foliage instances together in natural-looking arrangements rather than having uniformly distributed individual instances.

---

### Regular WorldScape Foliage

Regular WorldScape Foliage is the standard foliage spawning method that uses instanced static meshes for efficient rendering of vegetation across the terrain.

---

### Applying your Foliage Collection

To apply your foliage collection, add it to the foliage collection list in your WorldScape actor's foliage tab. The foliage will automatically spawn based on the terrain's temperature and humidity values combined with your placement constraint parameters.

---

### Foliage Layer Masking

Foliage Layer Masking allows you to exclude foliage spawn in specific areas. This is useful for creating clearings, paths, or areas where buildings will be placed.

---

### Foliage Volume

Foliage Volumes are area-based volumes that can override or modify foliage spawning within their boundaries. They can be used to create specific vegetation zones independent of the global foliage settings.

---

### Foliage Baker (Beta)

Foliage Baker is a beta feature that allows you to bake procedural foliage into static foliage instances for improved performance in areas that don't need dynamic foliage generation.

---

## Terrain Material

*Caution: The materials inside the project are placeholder. New materials, better suited for WorldScape, will be made and provided in the future. This article will explain the role of each parameter without going too far into details. Feel free to use the current materials as examples and create new ones or modify them to suit your needs.*

### Material Overview

The material for WorldScape 5.0 and above functions differently than the legacy to allow for more customization to your landscape allowing for both flexibility and realism. Most of the controls for the material are controlled in the blueprint actor of "BP_WorldScapeManager".

If you are using Unreal Engine 4.26 - 4.27, refer to [Terrain Material Legacy](#terrain-material-legacy).

### World Material Settings

When using WorldScape you may notice these options:

These new settings control the appearance of the landscape, and most of the values are straight forward. It should be noted that:

- **Bottom layer** - controls the coastline aspects of the landscape
- **Mid color layer 1** - controls the humid areas
- **Mid color layer 2** - controls the dry areas
- **Top layer** - controls the snow caps and overall snow color
- **Surface noise** - controls texture details seen from space

#### Mid Layer Color Information

**Mid color layer 1:**
- Colors 1-3 control the temperate grass color
- Color 4 controls the cold tundra colors closer around the colder parts near the edge of snow
- Color 5 controls the savanna colors around the landscape and more noticeable to the transition of desert

**Mid color layer 2:**
- Colors 1-2 control the sand color around the landscape
- Color 3 controls the top rock colors seen on mountains or dry cold areas
- Color 4 controls the tint of the sand
- Color 5 has no effect on anything

As for the **Layer tab**, that controls the height and sharpness transition of each of the primary layers (bottom, mid, and top).

Keep note that the foliage does not respond to the material. But given some work into it, you can make your own system or modify that foliage material to correspond to the colors associated.

---

### Terrain Material Legacy

The legacy terrain material system was used in Unreal Engine 4.26 - 4.27. It provides a triplanar material setup for the WorldScape terrain. For users on engine versions below 5.0, refer to this section for material configuration.

---

## Setting up a World from Scratch

So first off in the Place Actor tab type in "WorldScape" and you will see "WorldScapeRoot" and drag it into the scene, as well as a Directional Light. The same can be applied to the WorldScape Manager when following through this section on adding WorldScape terrain to empty worlds.

Now placed in the scene, for this instance for a planet, make sure you set the generation type to **"planet"** and have **Generate** and **Generate Ocean** checked.

You're immediately going to notice you don't see anything: that's because the planet's surface is way above. So you can just paste this coordinate for the transform of the planet:
```
(X=0.000000, Y=0.000000, Z=-637875790.000000)
```

Then scroll down a bit and you'll find where to put materials. You can copy over the materials from the planet example map or make your own.

Once that's done you can then scroll back up to where you see the Foliage tab and you can add foliage collection to that list.

And you can add other things such as atmosphere and skylight and you have your planet.

**As for flat world,** it's basically the same except that you choose "Flat World" and make sure the transform location is set to `(0, 0, 0)`.

---

## WS Tools

Worldscape (WS) Tools is a powerful and user-friendly plugin feature designed to enhance the planetary options within the landscape plugin. This toolset offers a dedicated toolbar that simplifies navigation and provides a seamless experience when working with planetary landscapes. WS Tools gives ease to users for the ability to explore, manipulate, and create stunning virtual worlds with ease.

**Please keep in mind** that some of these features are in beta and the following items may change or be removed and may be unstable. So some information may already be outdated by the time of release and changes to the docs will be made during full stable release of WS Tools section.

---

### How to Get Toolbar Running

Instructions for enabling and configuring the WS Tools toolbar in your Unreal Engine editor. The toolbar provides quick access to WorldScape-specific tools and navigation options.

---

### Detailed Overview

A comprehensive overview of all WS Tools features and their functionality within the editor environment.

---

### Heightmap Editor (Beta)

The Heightmap Editor provides tools for:

- **Edit Heightmap Data (Beta)** - Edit existing heightmap data directly within the editor
- **Create Landscape (Beta)** - Create new landscapes using the WS Tools interface
- **Landscape Export (Beta and Extras)** - Export landscapes and heightmaps

---

### Heightmap Tools Volume (Beta)

The Heightmap Tools Volume provides additional heightmap manipulation capabilities within a defined volume area.

---

# Grid Spawner

> **WARNING:** The documentation is not finished. Grid is Experimental.

Grid Spawner is an alternative spawn system that only spawns on planet surfaces.

The system allows:

- Spawning on both the client and server sides
- Maintaining a pre-defined location structure, with randomness control applied
- Spawning actors with parameters (serialization)
- Auto-snapping spawned elements onto the planet's surface while maintaining their overall structure

---

## Planetary Grid Data

Planetary Grid Data defines the grid structure used for spawning elements on planetary surfaces. It controls the distribution pattern and density of spawned objects.

---

## Grid Data Asset

Grid Data Asset stores the configuration for grid-based spawning, including spawn patterns, density settings, and actor references.

---

# Snap Actor

> **WARNING:** The documentation is not finished. Snap is Experimental.

Snap Actor is a derivative of Grid Spawner, except that this one is directly by placing an actor on the surface of the planet.

The system allows:

- Spawning elements (StaticMesh and actor, serialized or not) with a general structure maintained
- Snapping elements to the surface of the terrain
- Managing the spawn quantity directly with a manager

---

# Volume Pooling

> **WARNING:** The documentation is not finished. Volume Pooling is BETA.

Volume pooling is a method that allows you to keep the number of active volumes low in the field.

You can at any time in C++ or Blueprint request a volume from WorldScape root, which will be a volume that is part of the pooling list, then configure it and place it where you want.

---

# Foliage Collision Pooling

> **WARNING:** The documentation is not finished. Foliage Collision Pooling is BETA.

Foliage Collision Pooling is a new method for foliage collisions to address micro-freezing issues when spawning large amounts of foliage.

This allows all foliage to spawn without collision, then automatically moves the collision around the player, resulting in a significant performance gain when spawning foliage, especially at great distances.

This system only works on the client side.

---

# Gravity Value

> **WARNING:** The documentation is not finished. Gravity is BETA.

Gravity Value is a simple system that allows you to calculate the gravity at a given point on planets and flat worlds. This allows you to directly obtain a usable value to determine the gravity at a given location.

Currently, no force is applied to objects; you must obtain this value yourself from the planet or from the subsystem.

---

# SubSystem

> **WARNING:** The documentation is not finished. SubSystem is BETA.

The Subsystem now supports several basic routines:

- It allows you to update the terrain closest to the player, which allows you to transfer parameters from one terrain to another.
- It allows you to know the orientation from the center of the planets in real time.
- It automatically updates a Material Parameter Collection with planet and flat world parameters.
- It allows you to know when a planet is registered or when it is destroyed.

All systems have delegates that you can connect to your own system.

---

# FAQ

### I can walk on planet surface?

Yes.

### It's possible to use the material landscape provided for the original unreal landscape on clipmaps ground?

Unfortunately No, the Landscape material is designed to work with the LandscapeComponent. But the plugin offers an example triplanar material, you can improve it to make it as beautiful as that of your old landscape.

### Can I sculpt terrain in editor?

No, for now, you need to sculpt your terrain with heightmap software and export the heightmap. Use your heightmap in Influence to apply it to WorldScape terrain.

### Why my heightmap texture have artefact in terrain?

There are different types of artifact:

- If you have stairs on your heightmap, it's a precision issue of your texture. It is advised to use 16-bit textures and toggle the "High Quality" bool in the HeightMapInfluencer Data.
- If the artifacts are weirder (like random values) it is possible you are either: Using a non-power of 2 texture (resolution of 128×128, 256×256, 512×512, etc.) or using an 8-bit image as a 16-bit image, leading to texture reading issues.
- If you have any other issue, feel free to come on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/wzUNzPKuU2) and report the issue.

### Why are distant mountains suddenly appearing?

It's probably because your **MAX LOD** setting is too low. You should increase its value (advised value of 10-12).

### Why does the influencer Heightmap act weird to the terrain, yet I have correctly configured?

Sometimes it is necessary to restart your level or even your project to apply data. If it still doesn't work please join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wzUNzPKuU2) for specific help.

### BlackScreen in Demonstration Level?

Enable the Volumetric Plugin or Disable CloudVolumetric in level.

### Fail Package?

**Fix:** Enable WaterPlugin.

# GPU Terrain (indirect path)

Since September 2026 the planet mesh can be produced on the GPU instead of the CPU clipmap. The CPU path stays the
reference (collision, foliage, dedicated server, every height query); the GPU path only replaces the rendered mesh.

## What runs where

- Heightfield tiles (height R32F + aux RGBA16F: HeightNormalize, Temperature, Humidity, Hole) are generated by
  `WSHeightfieldGenerate.usf` with the same noise math as the CPU (five noise classes: Qanga, Earth, CustomWorld,
  TheMoon, HeightMapBased), the planetary heightmap (UV in double precision), heightmap volumes and hole volumes.
- A cube sphere quadtree (`FWSQuadtreeManager`) picks the visible tiles from a screen space error; each tile becomes
  one indirect draw of a persistent vertex buffer (`WSMeshGenerate.usf`, 112 bytes per vertex, vertex colour RGB
  sRGB-encoded like the CPU clipmap rings, which `UWorldScapeLod::UpdateMesh` fills through
  `UpdateMeshSections_LinearColor` with its default `bSRGBConversion = true`; the encoding is the bit-exact port of
  `FLinearColor::ToFColorSRGB`, see `WSPackColorToFColorSRGB` in `WSMeshGenerate.usf`; the hole alpha stays linear).
- Not ported: noise volumes (a root that has some stays on the CPU with a warning), ray tracing, runtime virtual
  textures, split screen.

## Activation

Per actor: `bUseGPUNoise` and `bUseIndirectInstancedNoise` on `AWorldScapeRoot`. Project wide: `ws.GPUNoise=1` and
`ws.IndirectInstancing=1` (`-1` keeps the actor setting, `0` forces the CPU). A dedicated server or a NullRHI process
always uses the CPU whatever the flags say.

## Quality versus cost

`Quadtree_ScreenSpaceErrorThresholdPixels` decides when a tile splits: when the projected error of one heightfield
texel exceeds that many pixels. 0 (default) is automatic: `ws.GPUTerrain.Quadtree.AutoThresholdFactor` (2.75) x
(viewport height / (2 tan(fov/2))) / texels per tile side, which reproduces the image of the CPU clipmap for the same
LodResolution on any screen (measured on L_Dev_Claude at LodResolution 128: CPU clipmap 47 to 51 fps; GPU at the
automatic 8 px 35 to 39 fps with a pixel-identical image; at 16 px, factor 5.5, 50 to 58 fps but the per-vertex biome
masks smooth out; a fixed 2 px drew 5.7 M vertices at 18.7 fps). The effective threshold is printed as `SSE=` in the
statistics line. The biome masks and the water depth are vertex colours, so a coarser mesh always softens them.

The error distance is measured to the terrain radius under the camera (`FWSQuadtreeFrameParams::CameraGroundRadius`,
camera radius minus `PlayerDistanceToGround`), not to the sphere of radius PlanetScale: the ground can sit NoiseIntensity
above that sphere, and measured to the sphere every tile looked 10 km away at eye level on L_Dev_Claude (tree stuck at
depth 11, 24 m cells, where the clipmap draws 3 m). `Quadtree_MaxDepth` (16, up to 27) bounds the finest tile: on a
3169 km radius depth 16 is a 97 m tile with 0.76 m cells.

## Budgets

- `ws.GPUTerrain.MaxVertexPoolMB` (768): ceiling of the vertex pool (32 bytes per packed vertex, a 128 x 128 tile is
  512 KB); the quadtree leaf caps are derived from it (80 percent land, 20 percent ocean, scaled by 1 / LodResolution^2). Beyond the ceiling chunks are not meshed and a
  throttled warning explains why.
- `IndirectNoise_HeightfieldMemoryBudgetBytes` (0 = automatic: three times the leaf caps, clamped to 2 GB) and
  `IndirectNoise_TileResolution` (0 = the largest of LodResolution, OceanLodResolution and IndirectNoise_MeshResolution).
  The working set of the cache is the visible leaves, their parents (kept for the merge hysteresis) and the leaves just
  outside the view; twice the caps saturated at ground level (log line `Using over-budget allowance` every second) and
  a camera turn showed holes while the evicted tiles regenerated. A leaf drawn without a heightfield is requested as
  urgent: generated first and beyond the adaptive per tick cap (at most 8 urgent tiles per tick on top of it: a 64 tile
  burst on a loaded frame was a GPU timeout on the Steam dev build), and a node whose children are missing requests its
  own tile before their prefetch. `stat gpu` shows `WSHeightfieldGenerate` and `WSGPUTerrainMesh`.
- `IndirectNoise_MeshResolution` (0 = LodResolution): vertices per side of a GPU tile, decoupled from the CPU clipmap so a
  root can keep LodResolution 16 for the fallback and the dedicated server while the GPU mesh runs at 128.
- `ws.GPUTerrain.Indirect.HeightfieldTickBudgetMs` (6.0): CPU submit budget of the heightfield generation per tick. The
  number of tiles generated per tick adapts between 4 and 64 (`MaxAdaptiveGenerationsPerTick`): it halves when the
  submit exceeds the budget, or when the frame time exceeds 1.5 x the idle frame time (never below 50 ms), and doubles
  while the frame stays within 1.25 x the idle frame time (never below 25 ms). The idle reference is the average
  frame time of the ticks that generated nothing, so a render bound editor (21 fps at LodResolution 128) still
  generates tiles at full speed. Tile textures are pooled per resolution (RHI creation was the dominant cost).

## Instanced draws

Tiles are drawn as instances: one draw per (stitch index buffer, material slot, winding, water) group, about ten on the
ground instead of one per tile (300 to 450 before). The vertex factory (`FWSTerrainVertexFactory`) declares no vertex
stream: it fetches the 32 byte packed vertex (float3 position, SNORM8 tangents, UNORM8 colour, half UV) from the pool
with SV_VertexID, and the tile (vertex base, tile centre split in two floats, `FWSTerrainInstanceData`) from a per
frame instance buffer with the GPU scene instance index (`InstanceId - InstanceSceneDataOffset`, so instance culling may
reorder instances). `FDrawItem::FirstInstance` travels in `FMeshBatchElement::UserIndex`, the batch declares
`NumInstances` identity instances through `FMeshBatchDynamicPrimitiveData`. The tile centre is computed once on the
CPU in double (`WS_ComputeTileCenter`) and given to both the mesh compute and the instance, so both sides agree bit for
bit. That centre is the centre of the tile on the cube face, not on the sphere: on the flanks of a face it sits
hundreds of km from the ground (0.73 x PlanetScale at a corner), which left a float vertex only 8 to 16 cm of
resolution (a constant 4 to 8 cm error, a staircase of blocks below ~3 m cells, quadtree depth 14 and deeper;
invisible at the centre of a face such as the pole of L_Dev_Claude). Since 2026-09-05 the vertices are stored relative
to a tile reference point: that centre lifted to the sphere and to the height of the centre texel
(`ComputeTileReferenceOffset` in `WSMeshGenerate.usf`, all in double). The float3 offset between the CPU centre and the
reference travels in the padding word of the first three vertices of the tile; the vertex factory reads it back and
rebuilds the camera relative position with error free float sums (`WSTwoSum`), so the cancellation of the two large
terms (camera to cube centre, centre to terrain) loses nothing. Emulated error: 0.005 cm at any depth. The remaining
floor (about 0.15 to 0.3 cm) comes from the noise ports accumulating `HeightNorm` in float and from the R32F height
texel: visible only below ~3 cm cells (depth 21 and deeper). Tiles that are not renderable this frame get no instance
at all. Statistics: `DrawItems=` (groups), `Instances=`,
`Inst=` (instance buffer KB), `ProxyInst=` (the proxy saw the instance buffer).
Every instance carries its own local bounds (`WS_ComputeTileLocalBounds`: the tile's 3 x 3 grid lifted to the sphere,
plus the height margin and the sphere sagitta), passed through `FMeshBatchDynamicPrimitiveData::InstanceLocalBounds`, so
GPU scene culls tiles individually (frustum, HZB occlusion, virtual shadow map pages, local light shadow views). Without
them an instance inherits the primitive bounds, the whole planet, and is drawn into every shadow page and light view.

## Quadtree visibility test

Every node is tested against the camera before it is refined or output (`IsTileVisibleBySamples` in
`WSQuadtreeManager.cpp`): the camera space box of its sample points, expanded by the height margin
(`MaxDisplacementWorld`), against the four frustum sides, then a horizon test (the dot product of the camera position
with at least one sample must reach the squared radius of the sample sphere, minus the margin). The samples are the
tile centre, its four corners and its four edge midpoints lifted to the ground radius under the camera
(`CameraGroundRadius`), plus, since 2026-09-06, the tile point nearest to the camera: the camera projected on the cube
face plane, clamped to the tile rectangle and lifted to the same sphere. Without that tenth point a node much larger
than the horizon had all its samples beyond it while the camera stood on the node: a root face spans 90 degrees and the
horizon test accepts about 12 degrees at ground level, so the root was culled, the tree never descended, and nothing at
all was drawn below roughly 20 km of altitude except within 12 degrees of a face corner or edge midpoint (the world
origin of the Universe sits 4 degrees from an edge midpoint of the +Z face, which is why the top of the planet always
worked and the flanks never did). The horizon is that of the sample sphere (`SurfaceRadius`), not the reference sphere,
so ground below PlanetScale (ocean floors) does not fail the point right under the camera. With the debug flag, the
signature of a culled root is the warning `No draw work (Chunks=0 ...)` every second; `QVis=` and `QCull=` count the
nodes visited and culled.

## Stitching between depths

The quadtree keeps neighbours within one level at split time (`SplitDeniedNeighbor`), but the leaf cap and the merge
hysteresis can leave a two level gap, so the stitch handles 2:1 and 4:1. For every leaf and edge the neighbour is looked
up at the leaf's own depth (so an inner edge finds the sibling and never stitches, and cube face crossings resolve at
the right depth), then its parent and grand parent: the first one that is a leaf gives the level. The mask carries the
level per edge (2 bits each, W E S N) and the leaf's position inside its grand parent (X mod 4, Y mod 4). In
`WSMeshGenerate.usf` an edge vertex whose index counted from the ancestor's corner is not a multiple of the coarse
spacing (2 or 4 cells) is interpolated between the two enclosing coarse vertices, sampled from the tile's own heightfield
and its 4 texel border, so it lies exactly on the coarse edge: no collapse, no degenerate triangle, and both children of
a parent agree on their shared corner. The index must be ancestor relative because a child in the second half of its
parent starts at (resolution - 1), odd for even resolutions such as 128. Exact when the heightfield resolution equals
the mesh resolution (the default); gaps of more than two levels are not stitched.

## Kernel permutations

`WSHeightfieldGenerateCS` is compiled once per noise type (`WS_NOISE_TYPE`, the `EGPUNoiseType` id) and with or without
terrain volumes (`WS_WITH_VOLUMES`); `CalculateNoiseCS` and `CalculateNoiseHeightOnlyCS` once per noise type. A single
binary used to carry every noise class and the volumes behind runtime `if (NoiseType == ...)` branches: 4 MB of DXIL
(Aftermath dump of the Steam dev build), a driver PSO compile above 100 s that blocked the render thread until the
120 s watchdog, and a GPU timeout when several tiles were generated together. The dispatch sites pick the permutation
from the request's noise type and volume counts; the `.usf` files keep a default (`NOISE_TYPE_QANGA`, volumes on) for a
compile outside the permutation system.

## Checking parity

`bValidateIndirectInstancedNoise` compares, for one tile per tick, 12 texels (plus the texels under each volume) with
`GetGroundNoise` on the CPU. `bDebugIndirectInstancedNoise` adds the renderer statistics. Tolerances:
`ws.GPUTerrain.Validation.HeightToleranceCm` (8) and `ws.GPUTerrain.Validation.HeightToleranceRelative`
(2.0e-5 x max(|CPU height|, NoiseIntensity), the float residue of the GPU noise). A FAILED line gives the texel, its ECEF position and the raw
planetary samples. `ws.GPUTerrain.Indirect.ForceVertexColorView 1` shows the vertex colours.

Porting rule learned the hard way: never sanitise an input the CPU does not sanitise. The CPU feeds slightly negative
bicubic samples to `pow()` and its clamp turns the NaN into 0; the GPU must do the same (`WS_PowStdF`).
